Information We Collect

When you visit the Global Footprint Network website, Global Footprint Network may collect personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, and payment information. For instance, Global Footprint Network gathers information when you fill out the email newsletter signup form and donation form.

In addition, Global Footprint Network and its service providers use a variety of techniques to gather other information about your use of the sites, including, among other things, your IP address, browser type, mobile device type, content visited while on the sites, and the duration of your visit to the sites.

We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about site use anonymously and reports website trends, without identifying individual visitors.
